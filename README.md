# sweetpea-boards

## Customization package for all Arduino compatible boards from Electronic Sweet Peas.

This package installs all the necessary board level files for our Arduino (as in the IDE) compatible boards. Here's a short description on how to install the package.

1. Locate and make a note of where your Arduino IDE workspace is located. You can do this be simply selecting Preferences from the file menu, the Sketchbook location is what you are looking for.
2. Make sure you have a "hardware" directory available in the workspace. If you don't, go ahead and create it. Make sure it is named "hardware".
3. Download the board package file from this URL: https://github.com/Sweet-Peas/sweetpea-boards/archive/master.zip and store it in you hardware folder.
4. Unzip it to that location. You will end up with a new directory in the hardware folder called sweetpea-boards-master. You can leave it as it is but I would suggest that you rename it to sweetpeas.

The current package supports the following boards:

 * SweetPea Uno+
 * SweetPea UnoNet+
 * SweetPea Leonardo
 * SweetPea LeoFi

We will add new boards as they become available.
